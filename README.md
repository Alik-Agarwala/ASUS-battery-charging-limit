## üîã ASUS BATTERY CHARGING LIMIT

### For Linux üêß:

`Step 1:` Download the [asus-battery-health-charging.sh](https://github.com/alik-agarwala/ASUS-battery-charging-limit/blob/main/asus-battery-health-charging.sh) script.

`Step 2:` Grant executable permission to the script file.
```bash
  chmod +x asus-battery-health-charging.sh
```

`Step 3:` Execute the script, passing the desired charging limit value (1 - 100) as a command-line argument.
```bash
  sudo sh asus-battery-health-charging.sh 60
```
`Note:` This will set the battery charging limit to 60%. The setting will persist even after restarting. To change the limit, follow Step 3 and pass the desired value.
